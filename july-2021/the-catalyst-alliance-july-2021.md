Record of The Catalyst Alliance Meeting adapted from notes by Tevo

### Creating NFT badges as a means of tracking merit

Newmindflow is interested in contributing to NFT rewards

In respect of game development experience, Tevo has created a MMORPG game

Awarding people for participation with and NFT badge

Badges could be showcased on platforms such as :

{% embed url="https://somee.social/" %}

We could begin by manually awarding  NFT badges, then later figure out automation.

Looking at our track record, we can emulate who participates which is useful for IOG

If we lay down measurements then we can align on a track record, we can perhaps track the experts ballots created by community.
