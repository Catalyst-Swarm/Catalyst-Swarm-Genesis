huhuu and very happy thursday @everyone Community led initiative is starting to work on cohort improvements. We're offering a prize of 10 ADA and a unique NFT to help us define suitable tags for the funded proposals. We'd greatly appreciate your support with this initiative üôÇ

The first step is to define some archetypes by categorizing all previous funded proposals by defining tags... as there are a bunch of proposals, we ask you for your support to take initiative in this project üôÇ

How it works Step 1) Make your own copy of this file. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFkECwqnMUF\_qMJJHyMFhXH3Y5OWFMMUyeqrIRn\_C5U/edit#gid=0

Step 2) Check the assigned proposal row on the top right, add tags to the proposals which you think describe best the proposals purpose in the "Taxonomy" column and repeat at least 30 times to be entered into the prize draw! You can add multiple tags for each proposal separated by a comma (,)

Step 3) Change the "Share" access to the Google Sheet to "Anyone with this link can view"

Step 4) Fill this form to submit your work https://forms.gle/UpX8Xo19eXxfSqjh9
