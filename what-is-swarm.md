We are a self organizing Project Catalyst community, supporting the success of Cardano’s Project Catalyst and it’s community of voters, advisors, proposers, SPO's, projects and groups. 

The Swarm is a Collaborative, relation based Network in Project Catalyst. The main goal is to propose a dynamic and adaptable multi-stream structure to the Catalyst Communty, where Individuals, Groups and Projects can use their maximum amount of Potential to create common value.
