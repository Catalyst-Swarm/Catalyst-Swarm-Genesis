# Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis

The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook has been recording the activities of the Catalyst-Swarm from its formation in April 2021.

The evolution of Catalyst-Swarm from Swarm sessions in [April 2021](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/april-2021/swarm-sessions) through organizing After Town Halls from [June 2021](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/june-2021/after-town-hall#june-16th-town-hall) to hosting Idea Fest in [July 2021](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/july-2021/catalyst-idea-fest-july-2021) is all documented in the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook.\


The GitBook provides a useful reference tool for anyone interested in Catalyst-Swarm and its development and a valuable context for a community emerging out of the Project Catalyst experiment.  Catalyst Town Hall videos and slides are embedded alongside related After Town Hall "open space" events and activities.
