The session was recorded at 01.12.2021 Hosted by Tevo Saks Workshop participants: Scott, Raymond Mata, Natnael Demelash, and 2 other Community Members

In this session, we explore how to improve awareness of Cardano in the Ethiopian Communities. The Ethiopian community is missing an overview of all the opportunities that the Cardano blockchain offers
