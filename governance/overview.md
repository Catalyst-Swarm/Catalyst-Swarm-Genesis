description: Building an accessible distributed governance practice.

# Overview

## Requirements

In order to progress to a distributed governance practice there should be

1\) Full transparency of _what_ decisions are made and _how_ they are made (the decision-making process).

2\) This requires tracking of _who_ is involved in the decision-making process and the recording of _what_ decisions are made.

3\) This should be fully accessible on an open-source, web based platform. The full content of a distributed governance practice should be easily copied and reproduced elsewhere on a non-proprietary platform.

4\) Ideally there should be web-based user-friendly dashboard, so information can be found _without any specialized knowledge_.
