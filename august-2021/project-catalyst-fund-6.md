**Hello and happy Fund6 everyone**. We are a self-organizing Project Catalyst community, supporting the success of Cardano's Project Catalyst and its community of voters, advisors, proposers, SPO's, projects & groups.

We facilitate the After Town Halls, weekly Saturday Swarm Sessions, currently running Hackathon & the Idea fest.

How can we improve and include more people from the community? Start a conversation with us.

 **Problem statement :**

Town Hall is attended by highly engaged participants of the Cardano ecosystem. They need a moderated space for discussion and networking.

 **Describe your solution to the problem**
