  * Variety of presentations
  * Interaction, Q&A, Face to face
  * Short format of presentations
  * Networking, connecting, idea sharing
* What, if anything, did you dislike about this event?
  * Voting suboptimal: Not all presentations could be seen
  * Room structure should be by category and not number
  * Technical difficulties
  * More buffer zones, transition time between presentations, more coffee breaks
  * Time commitments were not met in all rooms
  * Running overtime
  * Switching rooms was a bit nerve racking
