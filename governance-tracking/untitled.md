# Overview

## Requirements

In order to progress to a distributed governance practice there should be

1\) Transparency of what decisions are made and how they are made \(the decision-making process\).

2\) This requires tracking of who is involved in the decision-making process and the recording of what decisions are made.

3\) This should be fully accessible on an open-source, web accessible platform. The full content of a distributed governance practice should be easily copied and reproduced elsewhere on non-proprietary platform.
