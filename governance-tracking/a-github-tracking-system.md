# A GitHub Tracking System

## Adapting the GitHub Issue Management System

[GitHub ](https://github.com/)has been predominately oriented towards software development and issues typically recorded stages in a software development lifecycle \(either as bugs, improvements or feature requests\). The complete content of a software project, its code, is held in repositories. Later GitHub introduced [Project Boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) where issues could be tracked using [Agile ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)or [Kanban ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29)methods. Recently GitHub added the [Discussions ](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)feature to their repositories - allowing for un-tracked informal threaded discussion.

Presently GitHub repositories do not only hold code but often also act as data sources, or as a means to subject data formats \(such as the [Cardano Token Repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry)\) and increasingly as a means to store and maintain documentation.
